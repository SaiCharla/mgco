\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\numberline{}Abstract}
\par This project is for developing an application to handle multiple satellite
thermovac tests at once using a single TDACS system. No changes (hardware and
software) in the existing system will be necessary. The application will be
loaded into a PC connected to both TDACS and Checkout networks.


\chapter{Introduction}

\par The current TDACS system is capable of handling data from a single
checkout team and by extension only from one satellite. This makes simultaneous
thermo-vac testing of multiple satellites cumbersome and error prone. In order
to overcome this bottleneck a network-merge application is designed which can
trick TDACS to process and store multiple satellite data as a single satellite
data. The user should have necessary naming conventions to differentiate the
data from different satellites. The scope of the current project is listed below:

	\begin{enumerate}
			\item Acquire GCO Data from multiple IP addresses (Multiple Satellites
					-Multiple Checkout teams).
			\item Processes the acquired data in to a single stream with the same
					protocols as received data.
			\item Send the data stream to TDACS system.
			\item This ensures the that no hardware or software changes are required
					for present system for acquiring multiple satellite data other than an
					additional PC which acquires data and relays the processed data as if it
					is received from one one GCO.
			\item An Application which can simulate all the above phenomena for
					testing.
	\end{enumerate}


\chapter{Application architecture}
The System acts as server to the present TDACS (which treats it as GCO itself)
and has an independent client to each and every GCO server (Satellite).

\par The above figure shows how the application handles multiple satellite data
and how it connects to the TDACS and also the ground checkout servers. The
application spawns off a client branch for every ground checkout server and
writes the data in to a .dat file named after the server's address (host\_port).
Then the Pipeline Server sequentially reads each of those files concatenates
the data and sends it to the TDACS.

\chapter{Future Scope}
\par The following augmentations to the current project are suggested:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Include a database which stores the incoming data by reading the
		files at specified intervals of time. An SQLite3 database would be
		ideal.
	\item Include real-time plotting feature on to the database using Pandas
		and Matplotlib.
	\item Augment the protocol to get more satellite data and store it in the
		database while sending only part of it which is in accordance with the
		TDACS protocol.
\end{enumerate}
